# Getting Started

## Windows

For Windows users, you can download the binary installer files. You can download installer below.

{% file src="../../.gitbook/assets/IESSR Tools Desktop 0.0.2.1 - Setup - win-x64.zip" %}

The install of the application is very easy. You can customize your install configuration or follow the default configuration.&#x20;

After install, you can see "IESSR Tools for Windows" in your start menu. Also, you can create a desktop shortcut while installing.

## Mac OS

There is not a binary installer for Mac OS currently. See [Source Code](./#source-code).

## Linux

There is not a binary installer for Linux currently. See [Source Code](./#source-code).

## Source Code

The application and its dependencies are developed under [.Net 5.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/) and [Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net). So you can download and compile code on Windows, Linux and Mac OS platforms. However, compatibility on the Linux and Mac OS platforms has not been tested.&#x20;

You can access source code at my Github Repository [IESSRTools](https://github.com/Hedaozi/IESSRTools).
